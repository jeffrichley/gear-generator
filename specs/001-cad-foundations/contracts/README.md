# Contracts Overview — Phase 0

This directory captures interface contracts derived from the Phase 0 specification. Although implementation will surface through a Python CLI, the contracts below express the same behaviors as REST-style endpoints for clarity and future service orchestration.

- (Removed) `openapi.yaml` placeholder — no HTTP endpoints are defined for Phase 0.
- Future phases can introduce service contracts if network-facing automation becomes relevant.
