# Contracts Overview — Phase 0

This directory captures interface contracts derived from the Phase 0 specification. Although implementation will surface through a Python CLI, the contracts below express the same behaviors as REST-style endpoints for clarity and future service orchestration.

- `openapi.yaml`: canonical interface describing environment verification, repository scaffolding, utility exports, and tolerance calibration.
- Future phases will extend or version these contracts as services become network-accessible.
