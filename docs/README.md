# Developer Guidelines

1. Install dependencies with `uv sync` (or `just install-dev`).
2. Use `just test` to execute the unit test suite (`uv run pytest`).
3. Refer to `docs/scaffold.md` and `docs/utilities.md` for guidance on the shared helper modules.
4. Follow the test-first workflow: write failing tests before implementing new logic.
